# How to run the completed project

## Prerequisites

To run the completed project in this folder, you need the following:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) installed on your development machine. (**Note:** This tutorial was written with Python version 3.10.4 and pip version 20.0.2. The steps in this guide may work with other versions, but that has not been tested.)
- Either a personal Microsoft account with a mailbox on Outlook.com, or a Microsoft work or school account. If you don't have a Microsoft account, there are a couple of options to get a free account:
  - You can [sign up for a new personal Microsoft account](https://signup.live.com/signup?wa=wsignin1.0&rpsnv=12&ct=1454618383&rver=6.4.6456.0&wp=MBI_SSL_SHARED&wreply=https://mail.live.com/default.aspx&id=64855&cbcxt=mai&bk=1454618383&uiflavor=web&uaid=b213a65b4fdc484382b6622b3ecaa547&mkt=E-US&lc=1033&lic=1).
